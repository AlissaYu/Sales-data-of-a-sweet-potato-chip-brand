# Sales-data-of-a-sweet-potato-chip-brand


File MidtermCase1data.csv  (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertasgabrys/Forecasting/main/MidtermCase1Data.csv) contains weekly sales data of a sweet potato chip brand for the past two years. At the end of the second year (starting week 88), the competitor company introduced a similar product into the market. Carry out an intervention analysis to assess whether that had an effect on the sales of the sweet potato chips and quantify the effect of the introduction of the new product in the market on sweet potato chip sales.
Steps: 1) data visualization, 2) interpretation of the patterns, 3) modeling, 4) interpretation of the results and conclusion.
